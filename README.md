# tasker-browser-extensions

It is very common for the tasks to be performed to be communicated through a web page.
With this extension you can add a button to any website using a regular expression. 
With this button and the power of [Tasker](https://github.com/atareao/tasker) no task will escape.

Install this extension from Google Chrome Store or Mozilla Store and update your Tasker App
Also you can download the zip files /to_store/stores/*zip

## Configuration sample

I have configured my extension to receive tasks from GMail. I fill the fields like this: 

* URL: `https:\/\/mail.google.com\/mail`
* XPATH: `//table//h2`
* PROJECT: `//table//h2`
